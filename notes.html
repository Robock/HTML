  <h2> What is HTML? </h2>
  <p> <b>HTML</b> is short for Hypertext Markup Language. It is a file system by
     which individuals communicate with computers. We write code in HTML format.
     Just like we write text in Microsoft Word to communicate with other humans,
     we use <em> Text Editors </em> to communicate with computers. A <b> Text
        Editor</b> is a piece of software that is used to write, edit and save
         code. We have a few options of text editors that we can use like Atom,
          Sublime Text, Brackets, etc. </p>
  <p>In order to write code, we need to think like a programmer. The 5 ways
    programmers think are:<br>
                <dl>
                  <dt>Procedural Thinking</dt>
                  <dd>A method of thinking that involves several steps.</dd>
                  <dt>Abstract Thinking</dt>
                  <dd>Finding similarities in different things to create
                    <em>Generality</em>.</dd>
                  <dt>Systematic Debugging</dt>
                  <dd>Finding possible causes of problems and fixing it.</dd>
                  <dt>Technological Empathy</dt>
                  <dd>A computer is a tool that outputs information based on
                    what a user inputs and programmers need to be mindful of
                    that.</dd>
                    <dt> Systems Thinking</dt>
                    <dd> Breaking big problems into smaller pieces.</dd>
                </dl> <br>
    <b> The World Wide Web</b>
    <p>The major components of the web are 1) Browser, 2) Internet, 3) HTTP and
      4) Servers. A browser is something like an internet explorer, chrome, firefox
      or safari that makes request via the internet to servers. These requests
      are made using an internet connection and a protocol called HTTP. HTTP
      stands for <em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</em>. Servers are dedicated
      computers that respond to the request from users with files that
      is displayed in the users' browser.</p>
    <b> HTML Markup / HTML Tag</b>
    <p> There are many types of Tags and Attributes
      that are used and the instructor has provided us with a <a href=
      "https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp"> reference</a>.</p>
    <p>Another thing I learned in this class is how to manage whitespace and
      have text on multiple lines using <b>Inline</b> and <b>Block</b> methods.</p>
